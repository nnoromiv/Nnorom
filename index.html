                I am a student of Redeemer's University. I finished secondary school in the year 2019 then proceeded to join the university to further my education, studying computer scienceto gain several computer related skills like the design of webpages or websites using all sorts of programming language
                My education in the university as a computer science student ends 2023, I desire to further gain Masters and Phd in this field.
                Looking back to my early life of education, I vividly believed I'd become a Medical doctor but with the advent of certain attitudes my love for computers overshadowed that of medicine.
                Started my education life in Diamond private school lagos <bold>(Creche)</bold> then moved to Faith-ville montessori school <bold>(Nursery 1 & 2)</bold>.
